/**
 * AppBlocker
 *
 * Coordinates showing the block overlay when a blocked app is detected.
 *
 * Two-layer approach:
 *  1. FloatingBlockOverlay — a standalone always-on-top AWT JWindow that covers
 *     every monitor immediately, regardless of FocusFlow's own window position.
 *     This is the primary layer and works even when FocusFlow is minimised.
 *  2. BlockOverlay composable (inside the main window) — fires via callbacks so
 *     App.kt can react in Compose state. Acts as a secondary / in-app indicator.
 *
 * Both layers auto-dismiss after 4 seconds.
